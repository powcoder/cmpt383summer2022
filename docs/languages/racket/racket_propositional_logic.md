# Propositional Logic Examples

Lets write some functions that process **literal boolean propositional
expressions** like `(t and (not f))` and `((f or f) and ((not t) and f))`. The
symbols `t` and `f` stand for *true* and *false* respectively, and, at least
to start, we will not have any variables. We are *not* using the built-in
[Racket] boolean values (`#t` and `#f`) since this is our own little language
different from [Racket].


## Checking Valid Expressions

We'll code two different solutions: one using many small helper functions, and
the second way using `match`.

The first implementation relies on these helper functions:

```scheme
#lang racket

(define (is-true? e) (equal? e 't))
(define (is-false? e) (equal? e 'f))

(define (is-literal? e)
  (or (is-false? e)
      (is-true? e)))

;; returns true iff lst is a list of length n
(define (nlist? n lst)
  (and (list? lst) 
       (= n (length lst))))

;; (not expr)
(define (is-not? e)
  (and (nlist? 2 e)
       (equal? 'not (first e))))

;; (p op q)
(define (is-bin-op? e op)
  (and (nlist? 3 e)
       (equal? op (second e))))
 
(define (is-and? e) (is-bin-op? e 'and))  ;; (p and q)
(define (is-or? e) (is-bin-op? e 'or))    ;; (p or q)
```

These are all non-recursive functions that check only the top-level form of an
expression. They *don't* check if expressions inside sub-lists are valid.

With these helper function we can now write a recursive function that tests
for valid expressions:

```scheme
(define (is-expr? e)
    (cond
      [(is-literal? e) #t]
      [(is-not? e) (is-expr? (second e))]
      [(is-and? e)
       (and (is-expr? (first e))
            (is-expr? (third e)))]
      [(is-or? e)
       (and (is-expr? (first e))
            (is-expr? (third e)))]
      [else #f]))
```

### Challenge: checking expressions with or

Implement `(is-expr2? e)` that does the same thing as `'is-expr`, but instead
of `cond` use `or`.

## Evaluating Propositions

Given a valid propositional expression, `eval-prop-bool` determines if it is
true or false:

```scheme
(define (eval-prop-bool e)
    (cond
      [(is-literal? e)
       (is-true? e)]
      [(is-not? e)
       (not (eval-prop-bool (second e)))]
      [(is-and? e)
       (and (eval-prop-bool (first e)) 
            (eval-prop-bool (third e)))]
      [(is-or? e)
       (or (eval-prop-bool (first e)) 
           (eval-prop-bool (third e)))]
      [else #f]))

(define (eval-prop e)
   (if (eval-prop-bool e) 't 'f))

> (eval-prop '((not t) and (t or (not f))))
f
```

`eval-prop-bool` returns [Racket] boolean values, i.e. `#t` and `#f`. We do
this for convenience so that we can use the built-in [Racket] forms `and`,
`or`, and `not`. If instead we returned `'t` and `'f`, we'd have to write
special-purpose versions of `and`, `or`, and `not` that work with `'t` and
`'f`.

### Checking Propositional Expressions Using match

`is-expr?` and `eval-prop` can be implemented using `match`:

```scheme
(define (is-expr2? e)
  (match e
    ['t           #t]
    ['f           #t]
    [`(not ,a)    (is-expr2? a)]
    [`(,a or ,b)  (and (is-expr2? a)
                       (is-expr2? b))]
    [`(,a and ,b) (and (is-expr2? a)
                       (is-expr2? b))]
    [_            #f]
    ))

(define (eval-prop-bool2 expr)
  (match expr
    ['t           #t]
    ['f           #f]
    [`(not ,a)    (not (eval-prop-bool2 a))]
    [`(,a or ,b)  (or (eval-prop-bool2 a)
                      (eval-prop-bool2 b))]
    [`(,a and ,b) (and (eval-prop-bool2 a)
                       (eval-prop-bool23 b))]
    [_ (error "eval-prop-bool3: syntax error")]
    ))
```

We no longer need the helper functions, since `match` takes care of
recognizing the expressions.


## EBNF: Extended Backus-Naur Form

`is-expr?` is a precise definition of what is, and isn't, a valid boolean
literal expression. It defines the legal expressions in a small language.

A more common way to specify a language is to use [Extended Backus-Naur
Formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form),
or [EBNF] for short. [EBNF] is a language designed for precisely defining the
*syntax* (not semantics!) of programming languages.

**Syntax** is the grammatical structure of the language. For example, `(define
x 3)` is a syntactically valid [Racket] expression, but `define x 3)` and `(x
is 3)` are not syntactically valid. The **semantics** of a language is it's
meaning. For example, the semantics of `(define x 3)` is something like "make
a new variable called `x` and initialize it to 3".

An [EBNF] description consists of a series of named **productions**, which are
rules of this general form:

```
production-name = body .
```

Whenever you see a `production-name` in an [EBNF] rule, you can replace it
with the `body` of its rule. The `.` at the end marks the end of the rule. A
set of productions is called a **grammar**, and grammars can precisely define
the syntax of a language. This greatly aids in the creation of language
processing tools like
[tokenizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Tokenization) and
[parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing).

We'll use the [Go EBNF notation](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Notation), which
is designed specifically for use in text. For example, here is the production
that [Go] uses to define its assignment operator:

```
assign_op = [ add_op | mul_op ] "=" .
```

Anything in ""-marks indicates a **token** or symbol that appears as-is in the
language. So in this production, the `"="` at the end means a `=` character
appears in the [Go] program, while the `=` near the start is part of the
[EBNF] rule.

Two other [EBNF] operators appear in this production. `|` is the
**alternation** operator, and indicates a choices between two alternatives.
`add_op | mul_op` means you can chose either `add_op` or `mul_up` (but not
both). `add_op` is also defined with the alternation operator:

```
add_op = "+" | "-" | "|" | "^" .
```

This production, named `add_op`, says that an `add_op` is either `+`, `-`,
`|`, or `^`. `add_op` is defined by listing all the possible alternatives.

The `[]` operator indicates an **optional** expression that can occur 0, or 1,
times. The expression `[ add_op | mul_op ]` means that the entire expression
can appear, or not appear. If it does occur, then, because of the `|`, either
`add_op` or `mul_op` is chosen.

Another [EBNF] operator is `{}`, which indicates **repetition** 0, or more,
times. For example:

```
identifier     = letter { letter | unicode_digit } .
letter         = unicode_letter | "_" .

decimal_digit  = "0" ... "9" .
decimal_digits = decimal_digit { [ "_" ] decimal_digit } .
```

This describes legal identifiers in [Go], i.e. the legal names for variables,
functions, structs, types, and so on. It says that an identifier must start
with a `letter`, and then be followed by 0 or more letters or digits.

In [the Go EBNF notation](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Notation)] `...` is an
informal short-hand that indicates an "obvious" pattern. So the
`decimal_digit` production is understood to be equivalent to this:

```
decimal_digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" .
```

The `identifier` rule lets us check if a sequence of characters is a legal
identifier name. For example, `up2` is a legal [Go] identifier. We can verify
this by tracing the `identifier` production. The first character, `u`, is a
valid `letter`, and the next character is a valid `letter`. The 2 is a valid
digit, and so the entire identifier is valid.

Now consider `4xyz`, which is *not* a valid [Go] identifier. It starts with
`4`, but according to the `letter` production `4` is *not* a valid starting
letter. So `4xyz` is *not* an `identifier`.

The `unicode_letter` production allows all characters marked as "Letter" by
Unicode. There are thousands of such characters, so they are not listed
explicitly.


## Example: EBNF Rules for Literal Propositional Expressions

Now lets write an [EBNF] grammar to describe the boolean literal expressions
recognized by `(is-expr? e)`:

```
        expr =  bool-literal | not-expr 
              | and-expr     | or-expr .

bool-literal = "t" | "f" .

    not-expr = "(" "not" expr ")" .

    and-expr = "(" expr "and" expr ")" .

     or-expr = "(" expr "or" expr ")" .
```

This [EBNF] grammar closely mimics the implementation of `is-expr?`, and so if
you start with the grammar it is often straightforward to create the
corresponding checking function.

[EBNF] *doesn't* require the productions to appear in any particular order.
But, for humans, we usually group related productions together, and often put
them in order from either from most general to specific, or most specific to
general.

The syntax of this propositional expression language is very [Racket]-like,
and every expression is fully-bracketed. This means we don't need to define
the precedence of operators, since the brackets always make that explicit.


### Example: Parsing

Consider the `not-expr` production. It is recursive because it expands into an
expression involving `expr`, which could expand into another `not-expr`, and
so on. This allows us to show that an expression like `(not (not t))` is valid
as follows:

```scheme
expr = not-expr
     = "(" "not" expr ")"
     = "(" "not" not-expr ")"
     = "(" "not" "(" "not" expr ")" ")"
     = "(" "not" "(" "not" bool-literal ")" ")"
     = "(" "not" "(" "not" "t" ")" ")"
```

Each step expands one part of the expression, and, by making the right choice
of rules, eventually we get the exact expression we want. A program that does
this automatically is called a **parser**.


## Example: EBNF for Racket cond Expressions

Here's an [EBNF] description for a [Racket] `cond` expression:

```scheme
cond-expr = "(" "cond" { test-val } [else-val] ")" .

test-val  = "(" bool value ")" .

else-val  = ("else" | "#t") value .

bool      = any Racket expression that evaluates to 
            #t or #f .

value     = any Racket expression that evaluates to 
            a value .
```

Note that the ()-brackets in the `else-val` production are *not* in "-marks.
Unquoted ()-brackets are used for **grouping** in Go's [EBNF], and in
`else-val` they are needed to precisely indicate the right structure:

```scheme
else-val  = ("else" | "#t") value .    // right

else-val  = "else" | ( "#t" value ) .  // wrong 

else-val  = "else" | "#t" value .      // ambiguous
```

This is *not* the official definition of a [Racket] `cond`. See the
[documentation on
if-statements](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html) for the
official syntax. [Racket] uses a different formal notation for describing
syntax, but it is conceptually very similar to what we're using.


## Example: nand-only Expressions

In [propositional
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus), `nand` is one of
the standard logical operators. `(p nand q)` is true just when `p` and `q` are
not both *true*, and false otherwise. In other words, `(p nand q)` is
logically equivalent to `(not (p and q))`.

Here's an [EBNF] description of a nand-only language:

```
expr = "t" | "f" | nand .

nand = "(" expr "nand" expr ")" .
```

This is simple enough to be written as one rule:

```
expr =   "t"
       | "f"
       | "(" expr "nand" expr ")" .
```

Both grammars describe the same language. The second one relies on formatting
to help avoid ambiguity, i.e. each of the 3 lines in the production describe
one kind of string.

Now let's implement some helper functions based on this grammar. First,
`(is-nand? expr)` tests if `expr` is a valid nand-only expression:

```scheme
(define (is-nand? expr)
  (match expr
    ['t            #t]
    ['f            #t]
    [`(,a nand ,b) (and (is-nand? a)
                        (is-nand? b))]
    [_             #f]
    ))

> (is-nand? '((t nand f) nand (t nand t)))
#t 
> (is-nand? '((t and f) nand (t nand t)))
#f
```

And here's a function that *evaluates* a nand-only expression:

```scheme
(define (eval-nand expr)
  (match expr
    ['t            #t]
    ['f            #f]
    [`(,a nand ,b) (not (and (eval-nand a)
                             (eval-nand b)))]
    [_ (error "eval-nand: syntax error")]
    ))

> (eval-nand '((t nand f) nand (t nand t)))
#t
```

## Rewriting Racket Code

The following examples show how [Racket] can **rewrite** code. Compared to
most other programming languages, this is relatively easy to do since [Racket]
is [homoiconic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity), i.e. [Racket]
programs are represented as [Racket] lists, and [Racket] has good support for
list processing.


### Rewriting an Expression Using Just nand

An interesting fact about propositional logic is that *any* expression can be
re-written as a logically equivalent one using only the `nand` operator.

We need three rules to convert a propositional logic expression into an
equivalent `nand`-only expression:

- `(not p)` is logically equivalent to `(p nand p)`

- `(p and q)` is logically equivalent to `((p nand q) nand (p nand q))`

- `(p or q)` is logically equivalent to `((p nand p) nand (q nand q))`

By repeatedly apply these rules we can transform any propositional expression
into a logically equivalent one using only `nand`.

Here we will *allow* variables, like `p` or `q`, in expressions we want to simplify:

```scheme
(define (make-nand a b) (list a 'nand b))

;; converts a propositional logic expression into a 
;; logically equivalent one that uses only nand
(define (to-nand expr)
  (if (symbol? expr) expr
      (match expr
        [`(not ,a)    (let ([na (to-nand a)])
                        (make-nand na na))]
        [`(,a or ,b)  (let* ([na (to-nand a)]
                             [nb (to-nand b)]
                             [nana (make-nand na na)]
                             [nbnb (make-nand nb nb)])
                        (make-nand nana nbnb))]     
        [`(,a and ,b) (let* ([na (to-nand a)]
                             [nb (to-nand b)]
                             [nanb (make-nand na nb)])
                        (make-nand nanb nanb))]
        [_ (error "nand-rewrite syntax error")]
        )))

> (to-nand '(p and q))
'((p nand q) nand (p nand q))
> (to-nand '((p and q) or ((not p) or q)))
'((((p nand q) nand (p nand q)) nand ((p nand q) nand (p nand q)))
  nand
  ((((p nand p) nand (p nand p)) nand (q nand q)) nand (((p nand p) nand (p nand p)) nand (q nand q))))
```

We say that `to-nand` **compiles** a propositional logic into a `nand`-only
expression, and so `to-nand` is an example of a compiler.

> In general, a **compiler** is a program that translates one language into
> another. For example, a C++ compiler translates C++ into machine code.

Together, `to-nand` and `eval-nand` can implement `eval-prop-bool`:

```scheme
(define (eval-prop-bool e)
  (eval-nand (to-nand e)))
  
> (eval-prop-bool '(t or f))
#t
> (eval-prop-bool '((f or t) and (not (t or f))))
#f
```

This version compiles the expression to nand-only one, and then evaluates that
using `eval-nand`.

### Simplifying a Propositional Expression

Sometimes we can rewrite a propositional expression as a shorter but logically
equivalent expression. For example, the **double negation elimination rule**
says that any expression of the form `(not (not p))` is logically equivalent
to `p`.

Lets write an **expression simplifier** that applies this one particular rule
to propositional expressions:

```scheme
;; double negation elimination
;; (not (not expr)) <==> expr
(define (simplify expr)
  (match expr
    ['t              't]
    ['f              'f]
    [`(not (not ,a)) (simplify a)]
    [`(not ,a)       (list 'not (simplify a))]
    [`(,a or ,b)     (list (simplify a) 'or (simplify b)) ]
    [`(,a and ,b)    (list (simplify a) 'and (simplify b))]
    [_ (error "simplify: syntax error")]
    ))

> (simplify '((not (not t)) and (not (not t))))
(t and t)
> (simplify '(t or ((not (not f)) and t)))
'(t or (f and t))
```

The `match` form clearly specifies the double-negation pattern. Also, the
order in which the matching is done matters: we have to check for `(not (not
a))` before `(not a)`.


### Converting `cond` to `if`

After you've written a few [Racket] programs, you may have noticed that these
two expressions are equivalent:

```scheme
(cond (test val1)
      (else val2))

;; same as 

(if test val1 val2)
```

If-expressions are often preferred because they are a little simpler and
easier to read. But when writing code you don't always know for sure if you
have only one test, and so it's wise to use `cond` everywhere. After your
program is done you could always go back and re-write single-condition `cond`s
as equivalent if-expressions, but that is tedious and error-prone.

Lets write a [Racket] function to do the work for us. We'll call
single-condition `cond` expressions **simple conds**:

```scheme
;; Deeply change all occurrences of 
;; (cond (test val1) (else val2)) to (if test val1 val2)
(define (rewrite-simple-cond expr)
  (if (not (list? expr)) expr
      (match expr
        [`(cond (,test ,val1)
                (else ,val2)) (map rewrite-simple-cond 
                                   (list 'if test val1 val2))]
        [`(cond (,test ,val1)
                (#t ,val2))   (map rewrite-simple-cond 
                                   (list 'if test val1 val2))]
        [_ (map rewrite-simple-cond expr)])))
```

`(rewrite-simple-cond expr)` first checks if `expr` is a list; if it's *not* a
list, then `expr` is returned unchanged. If `expr` is a list, then `match`
checks if it has the form of a simple `cond`. There are two cases depending on
whether the else-clause uses `else` or `#t`. If `expr` is not a simple `cond`,
then we use `map` to call `rewrite-simple-cond` on each value in `expr`.

When `expr` is a simple cond, it is returned as an if-statement. We call
`rewrite-simple-cond` on `val1` and `val2` using a small trick:
`rewrite-simple-cond` is called on every element of the resulting if-list,
even the `'if` symbol. We know from how `rewrite-simple-cond` works that any
non-list is returned unchanged, and so the `'if` is returned as `'if`. Without
using this trick, we would have had to have used this longer expression:

```scheme
(list 'if (rewrite-simple-cond test) 
          (rewrite-simple-cond val1)
          (rewrite-simple-cond val2))
```

### Challenge: if to cond

Write a function that converts a [Racket] `if` form into an equivalent `cond`
form.
