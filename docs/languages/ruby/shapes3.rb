# shapes3.go

# Based on shapes1.rb. printShapeStats is a method in the Shape module (not
# class!), and Rectangle and Circle include Shape as a mixin.

module Shape

        puts "#{self.class.name}: area=#{area}, perimeter=#{perimeter}"
    end
end

    def initialize(width, height)
        @width = width
        @height = height
    end

    def area
        @width * @height
    end

    def perimeter
        2 * (@width + @height)
    end

    def method_missing(m, *args, &block)
        puts "Shape: no method named #{m}."
    end
end

include Shape

    def initialize(radius)
        @radius = radius
    end

    def area
        3.14 * @radius ** 2
