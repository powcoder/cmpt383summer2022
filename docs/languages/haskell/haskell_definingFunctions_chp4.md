# Haskell: Defining Functions

**Note**: These notes are based in large part on chapter 4 of the excellent
book [Programming in Haskell, 2nd edition](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton. Buy a copy!


## Function as Equations

[Haskell] has many different ways to define functions. 

Perhaps the most common way to define a new [Haskell] function is to use a set
of equations. For example:

```haskell
middle1 :: [a] -> [a]  -- type signature
middle1 []     = []
middle1 [x]    = []
middle1 (_:xs) = init xs   -- init "apple" ==> "appl"
```

```haskell
> middle1 "cow"
"o"
> middle1 [1,2,3,4,5]
[2,3,4]
```

The type signature comes first. It's optional, but we usually include it for
documentation. The function body is written as a series of **equations**. In
the case of `middle1`, the first equation handles the empty list, the second
equation handles lists with a single element, and the third handles lists with
2 or more elements.

The third equation uses a **cons pattern** to get the first and rest of a
list.  `xs` is all the elements *after* the first element of the passed-in
list. `_` is the **wildcard symbol**, and in this case it indicates a variable
whose name we don't care about. Instead of `_` we could have written, say,
`x`. But since it wouldn't be used anywhere `_` is preferred.


### Explain the bug: middle_bug1

In your own words, explain the bug in this code, and how you would fix it
(i.e. re-write the code so it works):

```haskell
middle_bug1 :: [a] -> [a]  -- type signature
middle_bug1 []     = []
middle_bug1 [x]    = []
middle_bug1 (_:xs) = reverse tail reverse xs
```

### Challenge: outside

Implement a function called `outside` that takes a list of any type as input,
and returns a *tuple* `(first, last)`, where `first` is the first element of
the list, and last is the last element. If `outside` is passed a list with
fewer than 2 elements, then use the standard [Haskell] `error msg` function to
return a helpful error message.

As part of your answer, include the most general type signature for `outside`.

For example:

```haskell
> outside "apple"
('a','e')
> outside [2,1,9,4]
(2,4)
> outside ["up","up","and","away"]
("up","away")
> outside [5]
*** Exception: outside: list must have 2 or more elements
...
```

### Challenge: another middle

Re-write `middle1` in a different way *without* using `reverse`. Call this new
function `middle2`. It should have exactly the same type signature as
`middle1`, and they should return the same results for the same inputs.


### Challenge: testing middles

Implement a function called `middle_test m1 m2 x` that takes three inputs:

- `m1` and `m2` are middle functions with the same type signatures as
  `middle1`

- `x` is any list of elements of type `a`. Importantly, `a` must satisfy the
  `Eq` class so that the list elements can be compared using `==`.

`middle_test m1 m2 x` returns a `Bool`. It returns `True` if `m1 x` and `m2 x`
return the same list, and `False` otherwise.

As part of your answer, include the most general type signature for
`middle_test`. This signature is a bit long!


## Conditional expressions

In [Haskell], an expression of the form `if cond then a else b` is called a
**conditional expression**. `cond` must be a `Bool` expression that returns
`True` or `False`. If it's `True`, then the conditional evaluates to `a`, and
if it's `False` it evaluates to `b`.

Importantly, expressions `a` and `b` *must* be the same type.

For example:

```haskell
pluralize1 :: String -> String
pluralize1 "" = ""
pluralize1 s  = s ++ (if last s == 's' then "" else "s")
```

```haskell
> pluralize1 "apple"
"apples"
> pluralize1 "cows"
"cows"
```

### Challenge: another pluralize

Implement a function called `pluralize2` that works the same as  `pluralize1`,
but is implemented in a *different* way, but still using a *conditional
expression*. It should have exactly the same type signature as `pluralize2`,
and should return the same results for the same inputs.

### Challenge: testing pluralization

Implement a function called `pluralize_test p1 p2 s` that takes three inputs:

- `p1` and `p2` are pluralize functions with the same type signatures as
  `pluralize1`

- `s` is any `String`.

`pluralize_test p1 p2 x` returns a `Bool`. It returns `True` if `p1 s` and `p2
s` return the same `String`, and `False` otherwise.

As part of your answer, include the most general type signature for
`pluralize_test`. This signature is a bit long!


### Challenge: better pluralization

The `pluralize1 w` function implements two rules: 

1. If `w` ends with an `'s'`, then return `w` unchanged.

2. Otherwise, return `w` with an `'s'` added to the end.

Implement a function called `pluralize3` that has the same type signature as
`pluralize1`, but also implements this rule in addition to the first two:

3. If `w` ends with a `y`, then remove it and add `"ies"` to the end.
For example:

```haskell
> pluralize3 "cow"
"cows"
> pluralize3 "dry"
"dries"
> pluralize3 "birds"
"birds"
```

## Guarded equations

**Guarded equations** are useful when simple equations are not flexible
enough:

```haskell
sign1 n | n == 0    = "zero"
        | n < 0     = "negative"
        | otherwise = "positive"

> sign1 5
"positive"
> sign1 (-5)
"negative"
> sign1 0
"zero"
```

Even though we didn't write a type signature for `sign1`, [Haskell] inferred
one:

```haskell
> :type sign1
sign1 :: (Num a, Ord a) => a -> [Char]
```

In [Haskell], strings are just lists of characters.


### Explain the bug: sign_bug1

In your own words, explain the bug in this code, and how you would fix it
(i.e. re-write the code so it works):

```haskell
sign_bug1 :: Num a => a -> String
sign_bug1 n | n == 0    = "zero"
            | n < 0     = "negative"
            | otherwise = "positive"
```

### Challenge: sign with conditionals

Re-write `sign1` *without* using guards, and instead using `if ... then ...
else`.  It should have exactly the same type signature as `sign1`. Call it
`sign2`. `sign1` and `sign2` should return the same results for the same
inputs.

### Challenge: Heron's formula

[Heron's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula) calculates
the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides. Implement the function
`heron_area a b c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the lengths of the sides of a
triangle. If any of `a`, `b`, or `c` are 0, or less, then use the standard
[Haskell] `error msg` function to print a helpful error message.

For example:

```haskell
> heron_area 4 13 15
24.0
> heron_area 4 (-13) 15
*** Exception: heron_area: b must be positive
...
```

It's possible for `a`, `b`, and `c` to all be positive, but to *not* form a
triangle. For example, there is no triangle with side lengths 1, 2, and 4. You
do *not* need to check for such cases in this function.


## Pattern matching

[Haskell] uses simple **pattern matching** to match function inputs. For
example:

```haskell
coin1 :: Int -> String
coin1 1  = "penny"
coin1 5  = "nickel"
coin1 10 = "dime"
coin1 25 = "quarter"
coin1 _  = "unknown"  -- _ matches anything
```

```haskell
> coin1 25
"quarter"
> coin1 28
"unknown"
> coin1 1
"penny"
```

The first 4 equations in `coin1` match specific integers.  The final equation
uses the **wildcard** symbol `_`, which in this case matches *any* value.


### Challenge: a better coin

Implement a function called `coin2` that works like `coin1`, but the wildcard
equation returns a string that includes the value of the coin.  For example,
`coin2 28` should return a string like `"28 is an unknown coin"`.

`coin2` should have exactly the same type signature as `coin1`. 


### Explain the bug: coin_bug1

In your own words, explain the bug in this code, and how you would fix it
(i.e. re-write the code so it works):

```haskell
coin_bug1 :: Int -> String
coin_bug1 n | 1         = "penny"
            | 5         = "nickel"
            | 10        = "dime"
            | 25        = "quarter"
            | otherwise = "unknown"
```

### Explain the bug: same_bug1

In your own words, explain the bug in this code, and how you would fix it
(i.e. re-write the code so it works):

```haskell
same_bug1 :: Int -> Int -> Bool
same_bug1 _ _ = False
same_bug1 a a = True
```

The intention is that the function return `True` when its two inputs are the
same, and `False` otherwise. However, it doesn't work correctly.


### Example: nand

**Nand** is a logical operator that it is often used in hardware. Nands can be
used to construct every other kind of logical function, and so, logically
speaking, nand is all you need.

Logically, nand is defined by this truth-table:

|   x   |   y   | x nand y |
|:-----:|:-----:|:--------:|
| False | False |   True   |
| False |  True |   True   |
|  True | False |   True   |
|  True |  True |   False  |

In [Haskell], the definition looks similar:

```haskell
nand :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
nand False False = True
nand False True  = True
nand True  False = True
nand True  True  = False
```

Using wildcard `_` symbols, we can shorten the definition to this:

```haskell
nand :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
nand True True = False
nand _    _    = True
```

Each `_` matches *any* value. They do not need to match the same values.


## Tuple Patterns

```haskell
get_x :: (Double, Double) -> Double
get_x (x, _) = x

get_y :: (Double, Double) -> Double
get_y (y, _) = y
```

## List patterns

Functions that process lists often use list patterns. For example:

```haskell
is_expr :: [String] -> String
is_expr [_, "+", _] = "addition"
is_expr [_, "-", _] = "subtraction"
is_expr ["-", _]    = "negation"
is_expr [_, op,  _] = "unknown operator " ++ op
is_expr _           = "unknown expression"

> is_expr ["4","+","2"]
"addition"
> is_expr ["4","-","2"]
"subtraction"
> is_expr ["4","/","2"]
"unknown operator /"
> is_expr ["4","/","2","=","2"]
"unknown expression"
```

The first three equations match lists of size 3, and the last equation with
the `_` matches any list. `_` is also used in the list patterns for values
that we don't want to give a name to.

Another way to match a list is to use **cons patterns** of the form `(x:xs)`.
`:` is the **cons operator**, and can be used in pattern matching like this:

```haskell
firsts1 :: [a] -> [b] -> (a, b)
firsts1 (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x, y)

> firsts1 "hello" "there"
('h','t')
> firsts1 [1,2,3] ["cat","dog"]
(1,"cat")
```

Since neither `xs` nor `ys` is used on the right-hand side of the equation, we
could also write this:

```haskell
firsts2 :: [a] -> [b] -> (a, b)
firsts2 (x:_) (y:_) = (x, y)
```

Without `:` we could write it like this:

```haskell
firsts3 :: [a] -> [b] -> (a, b)
firsts3 xs ys = (head xs, head ys)
```

`(x:xs)` *doesn't* match empty lists, and so you need to handle the empty list
separately, e.g.:

```haskell
firsts_list1 :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
firsts_list1 [] _        = []
firsts_list1 _ []        = []
firsts_list1 (x:_) (y:_) = [x, y]
```

`:` can match multiple items at the *start* of a list:

```haskell
remove812 :: [Int] -> [Int]
remove812 (8:1:2:xs) = xs
remove812 xs         = xs
```

`:` also creates lists. The expression `4:[2,6,1]` evaluates to the list
`[4,2,6,1]`, i.e. `x:xs` returns a new list that is the same as `xs` but with
`x` added as the first element. Lists can be constructed from multiple
applications of `:` like this:

```haskell
> 1:[]
[1]
> 6:1:[]
[6,1]
> 2:6:1:[]
[2,6,1]
> 4:2:6:1:[]
[4,2,6,1]
```

`[4,2,6,1]` can be seen as a convenient shorthand for the expression
`4:2:6:1:[]`. We will sometimes call lists written in the form `4:2:6:1:[]`
the **consed-out** form of the list.

> **Comparison** `cons`  in Racket works the same was `:` in this case.

### Challenge: length of short lists

Implement a function called `short_length lst` that returns 0 if `lst` is
empty, 1 if it is has a single element, 2 if it has two elements, and 3 if it
has three elements. For lists of any other length, return -1.

Implement `short_length lst` using just pattern matching, and without using
`length` or other helper functions.

Also write the most general type signature. The return value is `Int`.


### Challenge: consed-out apple

Write "apple" in consed-out form. Strings in [Haskell] are just lists of
characters. Use single-quotes for characters, e.g. `'a'` is a character.


### Explain the bug: same_bug1

In your own words, explain the bug in this code, and how you would fix it
(i.e. re-write the code so it works):

```haskell
diff_heads_bug1 :: [a] -> [a] -> Bool
diff_heads_bug1 [] _        = True
diff_heads_bug1 _ []        = True
diff_heads_bug1 (x:_) (y:_) = False
diff_heads_bug1 _ _         = True
```

The intention is that `diff_heads_bug1 a b` returns  `False` if the heads of
the lists are the same, and `True` in every other case.


## Lambda expressions

**Lambda expressions**, or **lambda functions**, can be thought of as
functions without names. In practice they can be useful when you need a small
function that is only used once or twice.

For example, `\x -> x*x` is a lambda expression. It's a function that takes a
single input, `x`, and then returns its square:

```haskell
> (\x -> x*x) 3
9
```

Like any [Haskell] function, lambda functions can return other functions. This
lambda expression multiplies two numbers:

```haskell
> (\x -> (\y -> x * y)) 3 4
12
```

When this is evaluated, `x` in the outer lambda function is associated with 3,
and returns the function `\y -> 3 * y`. This is clever! This is called a
**closure** because the 3 is bound to the `x`, and [Haskell] automatically
keeps track of this for you. A closure can be thought of as function plus an
environment of bindings of values to variables that appear in the function.

Continuing with the evaluation of the expression, after `\y -> 3 * y` is
returned, it is applied to 4, and so this evaluates to `3 * 4`, i.e. 12.

If you like, you can use lambda expressions in regular function definitions.
For example:

```haskell
inc1 :: Num a => a -> a
inc1 = \n -> n + 1
```

```haskell
> inc1 5
6
```

This style of defining functions has little more punctuation, i.e. an extra
`\` and `->`.


## Operator sections

Binary operators such as `+` or `*` are usually written in **infix** style
with the operator going *between* its arguments, e.g. `2 + 5`. They can also
be written in **prefix** style using ()-brackets, e.g. `(+) 2 5`. Both styles
can be useful, depending upon the situation.

In prefix style, you can also write one of the parameters inside the brackets
to get what is called a **section**. For example, `(2+)` is a section that
adds 2 to its input:

```haskell
> (2+) 4
6
```

This can be useful with functions such as `map f lst`. `map` applies the
function `f` to every element in `lst`, e.g.:

```haskell
> (2+) 4
6
> map (2+) [1,2,3,4]
[3,4,5,6]
```

The position of the parameter in the section can make a difference. For
example, `(/2)` divides its input by 2:

```haskell
> map (/2) [2,4,6,8]
[1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0]
```

`(2/)` divides 2 by its input:

```haskell
> map (2/) [2,4,6,8]
[1.0,0.5,0.3333333333333333,0.25]
```


### Challenge: reciprocals

Write an expression that uses `map` and an appropriate operator section to
calculate the reciprocals of a list of numbers. For example, the reciprocal of
5 is 1/5.


### Challenge: fourth powers

Write a function called `h n` that returns $h(n)=1^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + \ldots
n^4$, the sum of the fourth powers up to `n`. Use an *operator section* in
your answer. If `n` is 0 or less, then use the standard [Haskell] `error msg`
function to return a helpful error message.

For example:

```haskell
> h 1
1
> h 2
17
> h 3
98
> h 100
2050333330
*Main> h 0
*** Exception: h: n must be positive
...
```
