# Haskell: Recursive Functions

**Note**: These notes are based in large part on chapter 6 of the excellent
book [Programming in Haskell, 2nd
edition](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton. You
should buy a copy!


## Basic concepts

Since [Haskell] has no loops, *recursion* is a fundamental implementation
technique.

A **recursive function** is a function that calls itself, either directly or
indirectly.

For example, the **factorial** of a non-negative integer $n$ is defined to be
$n!=1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n$, and $0!=1$.

Here is a non-recursive function that calculates it:

```haskell
fact1 :: Integer -> Integer
fact1 n = product [1..n]
```

And here is a recursive function:

```haskell
fact2 :: Integer -> Integer
fact2 0 = 1                -- base case
fact2 n = n * fact2 (n-1)  -- recursive case
```

Recursive functions are normally divided into **base case** and **recursive
case** rules. A base case contains no recursive call, while a recursive case
has one or more recursive calls.

Bases cases tell a recursive function when to stop. They play a role similar
to the conditional expression in while-loops in other languages. Try
commenting out the base case of `fact1` to see what happens.


### Challenge: recursive squares

Implement a function called `sqr_sum n` that *uses recursion* to calculate the
sum $1^2+2^2+\ldots+n^2$. Assume `n` is an integer greater than 0.

Include the most general type signature for the `sqr_sum`.


### Challenge: odd factorial

Implement a function called `odd_fact n` that *uses recursion* to calculate
the product of the *odd* numbers that are less than, or equal to `n`. For
example, if `n` is odd then $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \ldots n$ is returned, and if
`n` is even then $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \ldots (n-1)$ is returned.

Assume `n` is an `Integer` greater than 0. Include the type signature for
`odd_fact`.

For example:

```scheme
> odd_fact 1
1
> odd_fact 2
1
> odd_fact 3
3
> odd_fact 5
15
> odd_fact 6
15
> odd_fact 10
945
> odd_fact 20
654729075
```


## Recursion on lists

Recursion often applies naturally to lists. For instance, the product of all
the numbers on a list can be calculated like this:

```haskell
myproduct :: Num a => [a] -> a
myproduct []     = 1                 -- base case
myproduct (x:xs) = x * myproduct xs  -- recursive case

> myproduct [1,4,2]
8
> myproduct [1..10]
3628800
```

Here's a recursive implementation of the length of a list:

```haskell
len :: [a] -> Int
len []     = 0
len (_:xs) = 1 + len xs

> len "apple"
5
> len [1..10]
10
```

`rev` reverses the order of the elements in a list:

```haskell
rev :: [a] -> [a]
rev []     = []
rev (x:xs) = rev xs ++ [x]

> rev "camera"
"aremac"
> rev [1..10]
[10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```

In [Haskell], `(++)` appends two lists. We can create our own recursive
version like this:

```haskell
append :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
append [] ys     = ys
append (x:xs) ys = x : (append xs ys)

> append "apple" "jack"
"applejack"
> append [1.2,8.7] []
[1.2,8.7]
```

Recall that `:` creates a new list by adding an item to the start of a list,
e.g. `6 : [1,2]` evaluates to `[6,1,2]`.

This `insert` function assumes the input list is in ascending sorted order,
and inserts a given element into the correct location so that the list remains
sorted:

```haskell
insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
insert x [] = [x]
insert x (y:ys) | x <= y    = x:y:ys
                | otherwise = y : (insert x ys)

> insert 4 [1..5]
[1,2,3,4,4,5]
> insert 'c' "abde"
"abcde"
```

With `insert` we can implement this variation of **insertion sort**:

```haskell
isort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
isort []     = []
isort (x:xs) = insert x (isort xs)

> isort "apple"
"aelpp"
> isort [9,2,5,1,9,0,2]
[0,1,2,2,5,9,9]
```


### Challenge: recursive counting

Implement a function called `count a lst` that uses recursion to calculate the
number of times `a` occurs in `lst`. For example:

```haskell
> count 'a' "banana"
3
> count [1,2] [[4,1,2,1],[1,2],[3,4,5],[1,2]]
2
> count ("up","down") [("up","down"),("down","up"),("cat","jump")]
1
```

Include the most general type signature for `count`.


### Challenge: selection sort

Here is a [Haskell] implementation of selection sort:

```haskell
ssort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
ssort [] = []
ssort xs = [m] ++ ssort (remove m xs)
           where m = mymin xs
```

Using recursion, implement your own versions of both `remove m xs` (removes
the *first* occurrence of `m` from `xs`), and `mymin xs` (returns the smallest
element in `xs`).

As part of your answers, include the most general type signature for `remove`
and `mymin`.


### Challenge: unique strings

Call a string **unique** if all pairs of adjacent characters are different.
For example, `""`, `"m"`, `"up"`, `"abab"`, and `"once upon a time"` are all
unique strings. But `"aa"`, `"balloon"`, and `"What??"` are not unique.

Implement the following functions:

1. `is_unique s` returns `True` if `s` is a unique string, and `False`
   otherwise.

2. `uniquify s` returns a unique version of `s`. If `s` is already unique then
   it's returned unchanged. Otherwise, for each consecutive sequence of 2 or
   more identical characters, remove all but one of the characters. For
   example:

   ```haskell
    > uniquify "aaaabccddd"
    "abcd"
    > uniquify "apple"
    "aple"
    > uniquify "cat"
    "cat"
    > uniquify ""
    ""
   ```

   In general, `is_unique (uniquify s)` always returns `True`.

## Advice on recursion

The textbook provides more examples and advice for writing recursive
functions.

Despite their usefulness, in [Haskell] recursive functions tend to be avoided.
Recursion a somewhat low-level technique, and it is often better to use, say,
list comprehensions or higher-order functions like `map` and `zip`.
