# Haskell: Types and Classes

**Note**: These notes are based in large part on chapter 3 of the excellent
book [Programming in Haskell, 2nd
edition](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html) by Graham Hutton. You
should buy copy!

## Types

A **type** is a collection of related values. For example, the [Haskell] type
`Bool` has two value, `True` and `False`.

In [Haskell], if `v` is a value and `t` is a type, then `v :: t` says `v` is
of type `t`, and is read "`v` has type `t`".

If `s` is a type and `t` is a type, then `s -> t` is the type of a *function*
that takes a single value of type `s` as input and returns a single value of
type `t` as output. We can say that the functions **maps** an input of type
`S` to an output of type `t`.

`::` can indicate the type of an expression, e.g.:

- `False :: Bool` says `False` has the type `Bool`

- `True :: Bool` says `True` has the type `Bool`

- `not :: Bool -> Bool` says `not` is a function that takes a `Bool` as input
  and returns a `Bool` as output

- `not False :: Bool` says that the expression `not False` evaluates to an
  expression of type `Bool`

Every expression in [Haskell] has a type, and most types can be checked
*before* a program runs. This is called **static type checking**. [Haskell] is
a **type safe** language in the sense that there will never be a type error
during the *evaluation* of an expression.


## Type Inference

[Haskell] uses **type inference** to determine the type of a value without the
programmer needing to have to explicitly write the type. This helps make
[Haskell] programs short and concise.

For instance, suppose `f` is a function that maps an argument of type `a` to a
result of type `b`. We write `f :: a -> b` to indicate this. Suppose also that
`e` is some expression of type `a`, i.e. `e :: a`. Then if `f` is **applied**
to `e`, written `f e`, the result is of type `b`. In other words, `f e :: b`.

Function application is summed up by this rule:

```
    Given: f :: a -> b  and  e :: a
-------------------------------------
Therefore:         f e :: b
```

For example, since `not :: Bool -> Bool` and `True :: Bool`, this rule lets
[Haskell] automatically infer that `not Bool` has the type `Bool`, i.e. `not
Bool :: Bool`.

It can also help us find **type errors**. For example, 3 is *not* of type
`Bool`, and so `not 3` contains a type error. [Haskell] catches type errors
*before* it evaluates the expression.

> type safe in this sense. They can suffer type errors during evaluation.
> Languages like C++ and Java *are* type safe in most cases.

## Some basic Haskell types

[Haskell] types always start with a capital letter. Here are a few basic ones
that you should know:

- `Bool`, logical values `True` and `False`

- `Char`, single Unicode characters, such as `'a'`, `'A'`, `'8'`, `'\n'`, ...

- `String`, sequences of characters, such as `""`, `"cat"`,
  `"hello\nworld!""`, ....

- `Int`, fixed precision integers from $-2^{63}$ to $-2^{63}-1$; you can write
  `25 :: Int` to force a number to be an `Int` instead of some other numeric
  type

- `Integer`, arbitrary-precision integers, i.e. integers that can be as big as
  you need; `25 :: Integer` forces 25 to be of type `Integer`

> **Note** `int` values are typically the ints used by hardware, and so are
> usually more efficient in time and memory than `Integer` values.

> **Comparison** Python and Racket use arbitrary-precision integers by
> default, while the `int` type in C, C++, and Java is fixed-precision.

- `Float`, single-precision floating-point numbers, e.g. 1.3, -0.002, 3.14,
  ...

- `Double`, double-precision floating-point numbers; they are like `Float`s
  but with more digits of accuracy

> **Note** A literal number such as 5 could be of type `Int`, `Integer`,
> `Float`, or `Double`. Use `::` to force it to be a particular type, e.g. 
> `5 :: Float` .


## List types

A [Haskell] **list** is a sequence of 0 or more elements of the *same* type.

> **Comparison** Lists in Python or Racket can contain values of different
> types. Arrays and vectors in C++ can only contain values of the same type.

If a list has elements of type `t`, the type of the list is `[t]`:

- `[False,False,True] :: [Bool]`

- `['s','h','o','e'] :: [Char]`

- `["red","brown","yellow"] :: [String]`

- `[["one","two"],["three"]] :: [[String]]`

The number of elements in a list is its *length*, or *size*. The empty list
`[]` has length 0, a list with one element has length 1, and so on.

A few facts about [Haskell] lists:

- The type of a list tells you *nothing* about its length.

- The elements of list must all be of the *same type* `t`. There is no
  restriction on what `t` can be.

- Because [Haskell] uses **lazy evaluation**, lists can be infinite. We'll see
  uses for infinite lists later.


## Tuple types

A **tuple** is a *finite sequence* of 0 or more values, and the values *can*
be of different types. [Haskell] use `()`-brackets to indicate tuples and
their types:

- `(False,True) :: (Bool,Bool)`

- `(False,'-',True) :: (Bool,Char,Bool)`

- `("Yep",True,'z','!') :: (String,Bool,Char,Char)`

The number of values in a tuple is called its **arity**, and the empty tuple
`()` has arity 0. Tuples of arity 1, such as `(2 + 3)` are *not* permitted,
since they cannot be distinguished from arithmetic expressions, e.g. `(2 + 3)`
is `2 + 3` in brackets.

> **Comparison** In Python, tuples of arity 1 can be written with a trailing
> comma, e.g. `(2+3,)` is a tuple, while `(2+3)` is an arithmetic expression.

A few facts about tuples:

- The type of a tuple tells you its arity. 

- The values in a tuple can be of any type, with no restrictions.

- Tuple arities must be finite.


## Function types

A **function** is a *mapping* from one type to another. `a -> b` is the type
of a function that takes a single value of type `a` as input and returns a
single value of type `b` as output. For example:

- `not :: Bool -> Bool`

- `even :: Int -> Bool` (tests if a number is even)

The input type and result type can be any types, including lists, tuples, or
even other functions. For example:

```haskell
add :: (Int, Int) -> Int   -- type signature
add (x, y) = x + y

range :: Int -> [Int]      -- type signature
range n = [0..n]

twice :: (Int -> Int) -> Int -> int  -- type signature
twice f x = f (f x)
```

The notation `[0..n]` creates a list of the values from 0 to `n`, e.g.:

```haskell
> [0..4]
[0,1,2,3,4]
```

A function that returns a result for *all* values of its input type is called
a **total function**. For example, `add` from above is total. [Haskell] does
*not* require functions be total, i.e. some input values to a function could
have an undefined result:

```haskell
> head []
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
```

`head` returns the first element of a list. But the empty list `[]` has no
elements, and so `head []` causes an error.


## Curried functions

Consider this definition:

```haskell
add' :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
add' x y = x + y
```

The type signature tells us `add'` takes an `Int` as input, and returns a
function of type `Int -> Int` as output. Usually, addition takes two inputs,
but when defined like this [Haskell] lets you pass in just one parameter. The
result is a function that is ready to accept the second parameter.

`add' 5` returns a function that takes an `Int` as input, and returns 5 plus
that `int` as a result:

```haskell
> (add' 5) 2
7
> plus5 = add' 5
> plus5 2
7
```

This function returns the product of three integers:

```haskell
mult :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))
mult x y z = x * y * z
```

Currying lets you pass the inputs to `mult` one at a time:

- `mult 8` returns a function that takes an `Int` as input and has the type
  `Int -> (Int -> Int)`

- `mult 8 7` returns a function that takes an `Int` as input that has type
  `Int -> Int`

- `mult 8 7 1` returns the `Int` 56

`mult` is a **curried function** because it can take 0, 1, 2, or 3 inputs. If
less than 3 inputs are provided, a (curried) function that expects the next
inputs is returned.

[Haskell] functions are curried by default. Two significant uses of currying
are conveniently making new functions out of old ones, and, letting us treat
*all* [Haskell] functions as if they have a single input.

The types for curried functions are usually written *without* brackets. The
type signature `mult :: Int -> (Int -> (Int -> Int))` is the same as:

```haskell
mult :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
```

Type signatures of functions are bracketed starting at the *right*, i.e. `->`
is said to be **right associative**. The right-most type is the type of the
function's output, and the others are the types of the input values.

> Schonfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel), and
> [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege).


## Polymorphic types

Some list functions, such as `head`, work with lists of *any* type of
elements:

```haskell
> :type head
head :: [a] -> a
```

`head`'s type is `[a] -> a`, where `a` is a **type variable** that can be
replaced by *any* type. Type variables are always written in *lowercase*.

When written by hand, type variables are often written as Greek letters, e.g.
$[\alpha] \rightarrow \alpha$.

A type with one or more type variables is called a **polymorphic type**. Here
are a few more examples of polymorphic types:

- `fst :: (a, b) -> a` is a function that takes a tuple of arity 2 as input,
  where the tuple values can be of any type. `fst` returns the **first** value
  of the tuple, so it's return type is `a`.

- `snd :: (a, b) -> b` is similar to `fst`, but returns the **second** value
  of the tuple, and so it's return type is `b`.

- `take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]` is a function that returns the first n elements
  of a list:

  ```haskell
  > take 3 [4,7,7,8,2]
  [4,7,7]
  ```

- `zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]` takes any two lists as input, and returns a
  list of 2-tuples of the elements of the list, e.g.:

  ```haskell
  > zip [1,2,3] ["cat","dog","bird"]
  [(1,"cat"),(2,"dog"),(3,"bird")]
  ```

- `id :: a -> a` is the **identity function**, and it takes one value of any
  type and returns the same value, e.g.:

  ```haskell
  > id 7.5
  7.5
  > id ["a","b","c"]
  ["a","b","c"]
  > id "pets"
  "pets"
  ```

Functions are values, and so you can pass them to `id`, e.g. `id head` returns
the function `head`, and `id id` returns the `id` function. By default, GHCi
can't display functions, so you get an error if you evaluate a function in the
interpreter.


## Overloaded types

[Haskell]'s `+` function works with any numeric type, and it's type signature
looks like this:

```haskell
> :type (+)
(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
```

The first arrow is `=>`, a "fat" arrow. The expression `Num a` is called a
**class constraint**, and says that the type variable `a` must satisfy *all*
the constraints in the `Num` class. `Int`, `Integer`, and `Double` all satisfy
`Num`, and so you can use `(+)` with those types of numbers, e.g.:

```haskell
> 23 + 40
63
> 2.3 + 4.0
6.0
> 4 + 3.2
7.2
```

Literal numeric values can have different concrete types depending upon the
context, e.g.:

```haskell
> :type 4
4 :: Num p => p
```

In contrast, the `String` types does *not* satisfy `Num`, and so you cannot
"add" strings with `(+)`:

```haskell
> "cat" + "dog"

<interactive>:25:1: error:
    • No instance for (Num [Char]) arising from a use of ‘+’
    • In the expression: "cat" + "dog"
      In an equation for ‘it’: it = "cat" + "dog"
```

Instead, use `(++)` to combine strings:

```haskell
> "cat" ++ "dog"
"catdog"
```

`(++)` has this type:

```haskell
> :type (++)
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
```

`(++)` is the **concatenation** operator. It takes two lists as input, both
containing values of the same type, and returns a new list of consisting of
all the values of the first list followed by all the values of the second
list.


## Basic classes

[Haskell] provides a number of pre-defined type classes used throughout the
standard prelude. Type classes must always start with a capital letter.

`Eq` is for **equality types**. These are types that can be compared using
`(==)` and `(/=)` (not equal):

```haskell
(==) :: a -> a -> Bool
(/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
```

Numbers, strings, characters, and bools all satisfy `Eq`. A list of type `[t]`
satisfies `Eq` just when type `t` satisfies `Eq`. Functions, in general, do
*not* satisfy `Eq`.

`Ord` is for **ordinal types**, that is, types that can be compared using `<`,
`<=`, etc.:

```haskell
 (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
(<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
 (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
(>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
 min :: a -> a -> a
 max :: a -> a -> a
```

Numbers, strings, characters, and bools all satisfy `Ord`. A list of type
`[t]` satisfies `Ord` just when type `t` satisfies `Eq`. Comparisons on
strings and lists are **lexicographical**, i.e. they check order
value-by-value starting at the left and moving right. For strings,
lexicographical are the standard alphabetic comparisons.

The `:info` command displays information about type classes:

```haskell
> :info Num
class Num a where
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
  (-) :: a -> a -> a
  (*) :: a -> a -> a
  negate :: a -> a
  abs :: a -> a
  signum :: a -> a
  fromInteger :: Integer -> a
  {-# MINIMAL (+), (*), abs, signum, fromInteger, (negate | (-)) #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
instance Num Word -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
instance Num Integer -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
instance Num Int -- Defined in ‘GHC.Num’
instance Num Float -- Defined in ‘GHC.Float’
instance Num Double -- Defined in ‘GHC.Float’
```

Notice that all the type signatures are listed at the start. The `instance`s
at the bottom show what [Haskell] types satisfy the type class.

`Show` is for types whose values can be **converted to a string**. To satisfy
`Show` a type `a` must implement this function:

```haskell
show :: a -> String
```

For example:

```haskell
> show 3.14
"3.14"
> show '\n'
"'\\n'"
> show 'a'
"'a'"
> show [1,2,3]
"[1,2,3]"
> show "off"
"\"off\""
```

`Read` is for types that can be **read from a string**. For instance:

```haskell
> read "[8,-2,6]" :: [Int]
[8,-2,6]
> read "5.22" :: Float
5.22
> read "5" :: Float
5.0
> read "5" :: Int
5
```

In some situations [Haskell] can't infer what type of value `read` should
return, and so it's necessary to use `::` as shown to explicitly give the
type.

`Num` is for **numeric types**, and any numeric type `a` must work with these
functions:

```haskell
(+) :: a -> a -> a
(-) :: a -> a -> a
(*) :: a -> a -> a
negate :: a -> a
abs :: a -> a
signum :: a -> a
```

For example, `signum` returns -1 if the number is less than 0, 1 if it's
greater than 0, and 0 if it's 0:

```haskell
> signum 3
1
> signum 0
0
> signum (-3)
-1
```

The last example shows a syntax quirk of [Haskell]. We must write `(-3)` in
brackets, otherwise [Haskell] interprets `signum -3` as `signum` minus `3`:

```haskell
> signum -3

<interactive>:16:1: error:
    • Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (a -> a)
      (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
    • When checking the inferred type
        it :: forall a. (Num a, Num (a -> a)) => a -> a
```

To avoid this confusion we often need to put negative numbers in brackets.

`Integral` is for **integer types**. These types require all the functions of
`Num`, plus two more:

```haskell
div :: a -> a -> a
mod :: a -> a -> a
```

For example:

```haskell
> div 8 3
2
> 8 `div` 3
2
> mod 10 3
1
> 10 `mod` 3
1
```

We can use `mod` and `div` in **prefix** style, e.g. `div 8 3`, or **infix**
style, e.g. ``8 `div` 3``.

`Fractional` is for **fractional types**. These types require all the functions of `Num`, plus two more:

```haskell
(/) :: a -> a -> a
recip :: a -> a      -- reciprocal
                     -- e.g. 1/x is the reciprocal of x
```

For instance:

```haskell
> 2 / 3
0.6666666666666666
> 3 / 2
1.5
> 4 / 0
Infinity
> 0 / 0
NaN
> recip 10
0.1
> recip 0
Infinity
```
