# Rational Numbers

A **rational number** is a real number that can represented as a fraction
$\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b \neq 0$ are integers. For example,
$\frac{8}{11}$, $\frac{10}{-4}$, $\frac{0}{22}$, and $\frac{12}{12}$ are all
rational numbers. But $\frac{8.5}{11}$ and $\frac{45}{0}$ are *not* rational
numbers. For simplicity, we will often call them **rationals**.

As with all fractions, if $\frac{a}{b}$ is a rational number then $a$ is
called the **numerator**, and $b$ is the **denominator**.

Any integer $n$ can be represented as the rational number $\frac{n}{1}$.


## Equality

If $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$ are rationals, then $\frac{a}{b} =
\frac{c}{d}$ if and only if $ad = bc$.

## Ordering

When *both denominators are positive*, then $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{c}{d}$ is
true if, and only if, $ad < bc$.

If *either denominator is negative*, then that fraction should be re-written
as an equal fraction by changing the signs of its numerator and denominator.
For example, $\frac{5}{-3}$ becomes $\frac{-5}{3}$. Then the formula above a
can be used.

## Inverse

If $a \neq 0$, the **inverse** (or **reciprocal**) of $\frac{a}{b}$ is
$\frac{b}{a}$. If $a = 0$, then $\frac{a}{b}$ has no inverse.


## Arithmetic

Rationals $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$ are *added* like this:

$$\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}$$

They are *multiplied* like this:

$$\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}$$

And, assuming $b \neq 0$, $c \neq 0$, and $d \neq 0$, they are *divided* like
this:

$$\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} = \frac{ad}{bc}$$


## Reducibility

A rational number $\frac{a}{b}$ is said to be **irreducible** if the [greatest
common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of $a$
and $b$ is 1 or -1. If a rational number is not irreducible, then it is said
to be **reducible**. For example, $\frac{8}{11}$, $\frac{-31}{-9}$, and
$\frac{8}{1}$ are irreducible, and $\frac{8}{10}$ and $\frac{25}{5}$ are
reducible. $\frac{8}{10}$ is reducible because the greatest common divisor of
8 and 10 is 2.

If $\frac{a}{b}$ is reducible, then it can be converted into to an equal
irreducible rational by dividing $a$ and $b$ by their greatest common divisor.
For example, $\frac{25}{5}$ can be reduced to $\frac{5}{1}$. The greatest
common divisor of 25 and 5 is 5, and so 
$\frac{\frac{25}{5}}{\frac{5}{5}} = \frac{5}{1}$.
